51.1% of the Vine reviews were 5 stars, while 38.7% of the non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary

From the results above, there is some good evidence towards the idea that there is positivity bias in the Vine program reviews -- the proportion of 5 star reviews is higher for Vine reviews than for non-Vine reviews 51.1% to 38.7%.

To further support this, we could do a hypothesis test using the idea that the proportion of 5 star reviews. The null hypothesis would be that the 5 star review proportion is the same for both Vine and non-Vine reviews, while the alternate hypothesis is that there is a difference between them. Doing this would provide better evidence for whether there is an actual bias, which could just be random chance based solely on the numbers above.
